# Sunshine

C# implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracer series([first](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8), [second](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CO7PQ8C), [third](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DN58P8C)).
My initial goal is to follow the books as close as possible, while leaving optimizations and refactoring for later.

I'll be using MonoGame as frontend renderer since I feel it would be much more fun to build a realtime renderer than to output to an image file. Tracer's dependency on MonoGame will be minimal but I wont bother with separation for other components(GUI for example) this early in the project(if ever).
