C# implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracer series([first](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8), [second](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CO7PQ8C), [third](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DN58P8C)).
My initial goal is to follow the books as close as possible, while leaving optimizations and refactoring for later.
