C# implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracer series of minibooks([first](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8), [second](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CO7PQ8C) and [third](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DN58P8C) book).
My initial goal is to follow the books as closely as possible, while leaving optimizations and refactoring for later.

My intention is to eventually create a functional real time tracer running on the GPU with some rudimentary game engine capabilities(movement, collision, scene graph, etc) while having as few as possible outside dependancies other than MonoGame.

## Current Status

Rudimentary functionality is in place, I wouldn't even call this a toy project at this point.
